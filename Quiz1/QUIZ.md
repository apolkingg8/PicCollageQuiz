## Challenge #1: Are the two rectangle has intersection?

### Overview
Given two rectangles. Each of them are defined with x, y for the left-bottom position. The other two numbers are for width and height. We need to determine whether the two rectangles are intersected or not.

The width and height is always greater than zero.

### Examples
```
Rect 1 => x: 0, y: 0, width: 10, height: 10
Rect 2 => x: 5, y: 5, width: 10, height: 6
=> Rect 1 and Rect 2 are intersected.

Rect 1 => x: 0, y: 0, width: 2, height: 2
Rect 2 => x: 2, y: 2, width: 10, height: 6
=> Rect 1 and Rect 2 are NOT intersected.
```

* Illustrate the algorithm
* Write a function which can check if the two rectangles have intersection
* Write tests to verify it works.
